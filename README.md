# GEC Hostel Complaint & Maintenance System

## 1. Project Overview

The **GEC Hostel Complaint & Maintenance System** is a web-based complaint management system designed for hostel students.

Instead of reporting problems verbally to the warden or writing complaints in a register, students can submit complaints digitally. The complaint is assigned to the concerned maintenance staff and the student can track the complaint status.

## 11. How the System Works

### Step 1 — Student Login

Student enters:

```text
Roll Number
Password
```

The system verifies the credentials.

---

### Step 2 — Raise Complaint

Student enters:

```text
Room Number
Complaint Category
Problem Description
Photo
```

After submission, the system generates a unique Complaint ID.

Example:

```text
SHC-20260927-A45F21
```

---

### Step 3 — Warden Checks Complaint

The respective warden receives the complaint.

```text
Boys Student
     ↓
Boys Warden

Girls Student
     ↓
Girls Warden
```

---

### Step 4 — Assign Staff

The warden selects the appropriate maintenance staff.

Example:

```text
Electrical Problem
        ↓
Electrical Staff
```

The complaint status becomes:

```text
Assigned
```

---

### Step 5 — Staff Works

The maintenance staff opens the assigned complaint and starts working.

Status:

```text
In Progress
```

---

### Step 6 — Problem Resolved

After fixing the problem, staff changes the status to:

```text
Resolved
```

---

### Step 7 — Student Tracks

The student can see the complete status history.

```text
Submitted
     ↓
Assigned
     ↓
In Progress
     ↓
Resolved
```
